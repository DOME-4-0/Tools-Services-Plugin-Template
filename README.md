# Tools-Services-Plugin-Template
This is a template for a wrapper that will allow third-party tools and services
to consume data from the DOME 4.0 platform, perform some functionality, and return 
relevant data back to DOME 4.0 to the benefit of the platform's users. 

The template has been created using [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter).
